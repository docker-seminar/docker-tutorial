# Docker Tutorial Web Application

The **Docker Tutorial Web Application** is an interactive leawrning platform designed to teach users how to write and
execute Dockerfiles effectively.
This platform allows users to **write Dockerfiles, build images, and run containers in a real execution environment**.

By leveraging **Svelte for the frontend, NestJS for the API server, and Go with the Docker Engine API for execution**,
the application ensures an intuitive and responsive experience while maintaining security and efficiency.
The Go-based execution engine runs the submitted Dockerfiles inside a controlled Docker environment, verifying the
correctness of user-submitted configurations without requiring manual intervention.

With an interactive code editor, instant feedback, and secure sandboxed execution, this tutorial provides a hand-on
learning experience that bridges the gap between theory and practical application.
